# mpdefault

Play a default on your MPD.

# Why?

If you are running a hackerspace, you probably know about this problem: people tend to annoy each other with music.

This is a somewhat technical solution for this social problem. We are well aware that there is no such thing, but let us try as best as we can. Music in a hackerspace usually does not serve the purpose of amusement. It is played to give the place a calm, inspiring atmosphere. An ambient of sounds, beats and some vocals that give you this science-fiction feeling you are seeking. People should feel like on a space station.

This is why we chose SomaFM's [Space Station](http://somafm.com/spacestation) as the default stream for our hackerspace. SomaFM claim to "spread peace and love through music" and we hope it will reach your community.

# How?

It's simple:

Install the dependency [python-mpd2](http://pythonhosted.org/python-mpd2/) and run the script!

To customize the default stream, change the variable 'uri'.
